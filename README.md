# pairings
- Run "python flasc.py" and follow instructions to receive pairings between two groups that have ranked each other
(note: is ItemA preferential)

## TODO
- Clean up code (it's pretty convoluted and ugly)
- Host on heroku
- Make results page display rather than as something to be downloaded
